Apache James Server

A web mail UI and control panel for Apache James Server.

Initially the web mail will only access the Apache James Server locally.  Eventually, it would be able to check other IMAP/S servers.

The control panel would allow administrators to control all aspects of the Apache James Server remotely, including banning offensive IP addresses.
